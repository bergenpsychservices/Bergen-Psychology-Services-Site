# Bergen Psychology Services

Static website for Dr. Alan Sheinfil, PhD. The revision introduces a concise homepage, dedicated therapy and approach pages, clear fees and consultation information, and a shared responsive design.

## Publication

The site is maintained on `main`. This revision was prepared in [pull request #1](https://github.com/bergenpsychservices/bergen-psych-srvcs-site/pull/1) and approved for publication on October 28, 2026. It preserves `CNAME` and the existing hosting configuration. Use a separate branch to review future changes before merging them into `main`.

## Preview locally

From the repository directory:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. There is no build step or package installation. The consultation form uses the existing live StaticForms endpoint; do not submit test messages unless you intend to send them to the practice. The separately supplied review preview disables submissions.

## Pages and assets

- `index.html`: homepage
- `about.html`: professional background
- `services.html`: adult therapy overview
- `trauma-therapy.html`, `anxiety-mood-therapy.html`, `substance-use-therapy.html`: focused service information
- `approach.html`: collaborative CBT/ACT-informed treatment
- `faq.html`: practical details, fees, insurance, and appointments
- `get-started.html`: consultation request and contact details
- `thank-you/index.html`: confirmation at `/thank-you/` after successful form submission
- `privacy.html`, `good-faith-estimate.html`: website privacy and estimate rights
- `assets/site.css`, `assets/site.js`: shared styling and navigation enhancements
- `assets/fonts/`: self-hosted Source Serif 4 and Source Sans 3, with licenses
- `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`: search discovery

Pages are plain HTML. Shared navigation, footer, metadata, and contact details must be kept consistent when editing. Original portrait, favicon, and logo source remain in `Images/`; the recolored logo is in `assets/`.

See [revision notes](docs/REVISION-NOTES.md) for scope, verification, and launch considerations.

Homepage links use `/` for the canonical homepage URL. The consultation form uses StaticForms’ `redirectTo` field to send successful submissions to `https://bergenpsychologyservices.com/thank-you/`. The confirmation page is excluded from the sitemap and has a `noindex` directive.
